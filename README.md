# Fix My Code Challenge

This repository contains my solutions for the **Fix my code** project at Holberton School.

Each task fixes broken code provided by Holberton, while respecting the original requirements:
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- `gcc` (for C)
- `python3` (for Python)
- All files end with a newline

## Tasks

### 0. FizzBuzz (Python)
- Fixed: print "FizzBuzz" for multiples of 15, not just "Fizz" or "Buzz".

### 4. Double linked list (C)
- Fixed: correct pointer relinking when deleting nodes.
